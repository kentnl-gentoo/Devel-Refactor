Devel/Refactor version 0.01
=========================

The Devel::Refactor module is for code refactoring.  Pass it a
a snippet of Perl code that belongs in its own subroutine as
well as a name for that sub.  It figures our which variables
need to be passed into the sub, and which variabels might be
passed back.  It then produces the sub along with a call to
the sub.

Included in this modules is an example script that pulls the
snippet of code from the KDE clipboard in Linux and passes 
back the transformed code the same way.
